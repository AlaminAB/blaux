                         <p>It seems like only yesterday it was winter. It was freezing cold, we had to bundle up to go outside, and it seems like old Jack Frost would never go away.</p>
                    <p>Christmas, then New Year’s came and went. But the undiscovered country was looming just ahead in the distance, just like the Titanic, we were steaming full speed towards the hidden iceberg in the misty distance.</p>
                    <p>But that was then. Now is now.</p>
                    <p>Most of us are still locked in our houses. And most of the national weather services report that it is going to be a <strong>SUPER HOT SUMMER,</strong> maybe one of the hottest for decades.</p>

                        <p>So, instead of heading for air-conditioned summer schools, nicely-cooled offices, or the parks and beaches, we are going to mostly STAY INSIDE OUR HOUSES.</p>
                    <p>And you know what that means. We’re going to have to crank up the A/C. Our houses and apartments are going to have to be on ALL THE TIME.</p>
                    <p><strong>DON’T FAINT when you get your first summer electric bill. It might be a killer!</strong></p>
                    <h2>There’s a Way to Stay Cool AND Save a Ton of Money!</h2>
                    <p>You don’t have to play the game of the greedy electric companies who want to soak you for every dime.</p>
                    <p>That’s because NOW, we have the <strong>AWESOME&nbsp;<a href="/">BLAUX PORTABLE AC!</a></strong></p>
                    <img src="assets/img/blaux-portable-ac-review4.jpg" class="w-100 mb-4" alt="blaux-portable-ac-review">
                    <p>What is it?</p>
                    <p>Why, it’s this little tiny cube that literally sips electricity with its <strong>BIG, POWERFUL BATTERY.</strong></p>
                    <p>You carry it wherever you want <strong>COOL REFRESHING AIR,</strong> and it <strong>COOLS YOUR PERSONAL SPACE!</strong></p>

                    <p>Pollen, dust, and who knows what else is all floating around in the indoor air. And the indoor pollution only gets worse when you’re inside all the time. Even particles from your clothes and hair get into the air.</p>
                    <p>The&nbsp;<a href="/">BLAUX PORTABLE AC</a> has a changeable, efficient Water Curtain to trap all these particles before they get blown on YOU.</p>
